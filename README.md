# MLforEquipmentMaintenance

Predict when machines need maintenance to avoid breakdowns and keep operations smooth.

## Overview

MLforEquipmentMaintenance uses machine learning to predict when equipment requires maintenance. This helps prevent unexpected failures and minimizes downtime.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare machine data for analysis.
- **Predictive Models**: Algorithms that learn from data to forecast maintenance needs.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Verify prediction accuracy.
- **Examples**: Demonstrations of predictive maintenance in action.

## Getting Started
